# docker-gitlab-ci-runner

Hint: The Dockerfile consists of copy pastes from several other files, to
include software like python, clang, nodejs, git, ssh, ...

These projects are: 
- https://github.com/jfloff/alpine-python
- https://github.com/smebberson/docker-alpine
- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner
- (I hope I did not forget one)
